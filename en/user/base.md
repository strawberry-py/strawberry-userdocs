# Basic, built-in commands and functions

## Commands

### `ping`

Display the latency between bot and Discord API gateway.
This can be used to debug slow bot responses.

### `uptime`

Display boot time of the bot and the time it has been running since.

## Functions

### Automatic threads

Some channels may create threads by default for every message you send.

This is used by QnA channels or other types of channels where the moderators want to allow discussions, but want to keep all their messages visible at the same time.

### Bookmarks

You can react on any message with the emoji 🔖 (**:bookmark:**).

If enabled, the bot will send you a direct message with a content of that message, including the author's name and link to the original.

You can use this to keep all your friend's jokes in one place.

### User pinning

You may not have the **Manage messages** permission, but you can still pin messages!

If enabled, you and other members can add the 📌 (**:pushpin:**) emoji to any message, and if enough of you react like this, the message will get pinned.

### User threads

Even if you don't have permission to open new threads, you can do that via the bot.

If enabled, you and other members can add the 🧵 (**:thread:**) emoji to any message, and if enough of you react like this, a new thread will be opened.
