# Language

strawberry.py framework supports localization. Supported languages are determined by our [`PoPie`](https://github.com/strawberry-py/strawberry-tools) package.

At the time of writing, currently supported languages are:

| Language | Code | Coverage |
|----------|------|----------|
| English  | `en` | Guaranteed 100 % |
| Czech    | `cs` | Community |
| Slovak   | `sk` | Community |

Both administators and users can set their preferred language.
The bot speaks English by default, but you can set preference for both guild and yourself.
